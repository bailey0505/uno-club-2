This File outlines how to use this application.

The file to run the server is controller.js 

The Application is going to be for the Point Park Uno Club adn will feature user login, stats and other things to be determined. 

*** NOTICE *****
We are not going to be pushing the videos, framework , and node_modules to git. Video files are to large for the git repository and we will figure out a solution for live implementation. The framework folder will hold all of your credential files and can be implemented and routes changes via the controller. The node_modules clearly do not get pushed since you can init npm to get themauto downloaded from the package.
